Starred_ml - Github Awesome list based on starred proejct
---

Are you a compulsive Github stargazer? `Starred_ml` is here for you! It will access Github `https://api.github.com/user/starred` API and fetch all starred repositories and dump a mardown that you can use as
`README.md` in a repository.

## Running


```shell
opam update
opam install starred_ml


TOKEN={{your github personal token}} starred_ml > README.md 
```

For full option list, run `starred_ml --help`.


_See [Templating](#Templating) section for details on the output markdown._

Will output something liket this:  

```mardkown

Generating your awesome `README.md`
---

You can run `starred_ml` locally, but it makes more sense that you atomatically generate a README.md in dedicated github repository. For that you can use my Awesome as a template [`https://github.com/paulosuzart/awesome`](https://github.com/paulosuzart/awesome).

You need two things:

   1. Select `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` under (YOUR REPO)/Settings/Actions/General.
   1. A PAT [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with starred read-only access that you must set to your awesome repository under 
   (YOUR REPO)/Settings/Secrets and variables/Actions, then in the `Repository Secrets` you can add your generated token with the name `TOKEN`. 


Templating
---

`Starred_ml` uses [jingoo](https://github.com/tategakibunko/jingoo) as a template engine. Create a template file (default is `default.jingoo`) if you want to customize. 
You can reuse the provided template [here](default.jingoo) and customize as you see fit. You can save the template with a different name. Use `--template` the specify a different template file. 

The availabe variables are:
   - `lang_count` - The total count of languages found (Including `Not set`)
   - `languages` - a list of languages detected across all starred repos
   - `by_language` - a list of objects representing starred repositories with the following keys:
      - `language` - the language of in question
      - `starred` - a list of objects with the following keys:
         - `name` - name of the repository
         - `html_url` - Github url
         - `description` - repository description
         - `owner_login` - the repository owner login
